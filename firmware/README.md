# CircuitPython firmware for The Dial Toner
- **This directory contains the code for all models of The Dial Toner**. Shared code lives in the [common](./circuitpython/common/) directory. Other directories contain hardware model-specific code. The [`bundle`](./circuitpython/bundle.py) script will create bundles for each model. The contents of each bundle can be loaded onto the corresponding device wholesale - all existing files should be overwritten. The bundle script also pulls in the necessary dependencies from Adafruit's CircuitPython library bundle.
- All code is currently written for CircuitPython 7. It has been tested on most 7.x releases since 7.2.5.
- All Dial Toner models are currently built around the [Seeeduino XIAO RP2040](https://www.seeedstudio.com/XIAO-RP2040-v1-0-p-5026.html) development board.
