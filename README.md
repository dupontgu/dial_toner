# The Dial Toner
A Mechanical Hex Color Picker.

- Dial in your color using the delightfully tactile hex switches.
- Built-in RGB LED's show the color you have selected in real time.
- Smash the button to send the color into your design software (or anywhere, the device acts as a keyboard).
- Can alternatively be configured to output RGB, CMYK, or HSL color!
